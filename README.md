# Async Art Flow Contracts

This repository manages the AsyncArtwork NFT system on the Flow chain. The Flow-specific code lives in the `cadence` folder. This includes the AsyncArtwork contract, the contracts it depends on as well as many `transactions` and `scripts` that users and Async Art will run. More detail can be found in the README of each directory within `cadence`.

There is also a `test` directory which contains unit and integrations tests. Details
on the test suite, including how to run it are found in its README.
