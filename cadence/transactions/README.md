# Transactions

These are the core transactions that power the operations with AsyncArtwork.

Most of these are operations that Async's users will sign via FCL on Async's dApp.

A few of these transactions are admin/minter only and will be run directly by the Async admin account to update governance variables.

Each transaction is named to express exactly what it does.
